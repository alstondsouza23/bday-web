                     <p>Heyyyy, when I first met you, I never imagined we’d get so close, but here we are. Honestly, you’re the most unpredictable and crazy person I’ve ever met, 
                     especially since I didn’t like you at first because of all the teasing and bullying. But it’s alright, I'm gonna make it up by breaking your weak calcium 
                     deficiency bones sometimes soon. But seriously, I always used to kinda regret the fact that I don't have a elder sister but god sent you. Our friendship 
                     really means a lot to me, and I’m glad we’ve become so close.<br><br>
                     I pray that you get all the happiness, and accomplish all your goals. I know you are stressed out about your internship but don't worry everything is gonna
                     be fine and I'm sure you'll end up in a good place. Ngl I'm going to miss you when you go to Bangalore. I'm gonna miss all the slaps and the pinches.<br><br>
                     I'm out of words..And trust me I didn't use chartGPT.. Not even a bit. I'm not sure if you would like this whole website thing.. I'm sorry I know I kinda messed up
                      with the colours selection and stuff..I would've made a better one if I had time. Anyways Happy Birthday again..I'll be aways there for you at any point in
                       life..Love you bro..And make sure you eat some calcium and protein because the slaps are not tight<br><br>-Alston
